Overview

Welcome to the Paris 2024 Olympic Summer Games Dashboard project! This project provides interactive visualizations and insights into Olympic data, including medal counts, athlete performances, event schedules, and more, all displayed on a beautifully designed Power BI dashboard.


Project Features

‚Ä¢	Data Extraction with Python: Python scripts were used to extract, clean, and prepare the data from the Kaggle Paris 2024 Olympic Summer Games Dataset.  
‚Ä¢	Interactive Power BI Dashboard: The dashboard provides rich visualizations, including medal counts, country comparisons, and athlete statistics.  
‚Ä¢	Dashboard Design with Figma: Figma was used to design a modern and user-friendly dashboard layout to enhance the overall user experience.   
‚Ä¢	Advanced Power BI Features: Utilized Power Query for data transformation, DAX for calculations, and custom visuals to present data in engaging ways.
Key Learning Objectives
1.	Data Processing:
o	Extracted, cleaned, and prepared the data using Python.  
o	Automating updates for real-time data refresh in the Power BI dashboard.       

2.	Dashboard Design:    
o	Designed a professional and intuitive interface using Figma.   
o	Best practices for visual design, layout planning, and color schemes for optimal user experience.   

3.	Interactive Visualizations:   
o	Built interactive dashboards tracking Olympic data, allowing users to explore the data from different angles.   
o	Visualized historical comparisons of countries and athletes in the Olympic Games.   

Technologies Used  
‚Ä¢	Python: For data extraction and preprocessing.  
‚Ä¢	Kaggle: As the data source for the Olympic datasets.  
‚Ä¢	Power BI: For creating interactive data visualizations.  
‚Ä¢	Figma: For designing the dashboard interface.  
‚Ä¢	DAX: Used in Power BI for creating dynamic and complex calculations.  
‚Ä¢	Power Query: For data transformation and preparation inside Power BI.
